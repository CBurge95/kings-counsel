<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Evolution of the Privy Council in England, 1540 - 1547</h1>

<div class="container col-10 p-3" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
After the fall from favour of Henry VIII’s final chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, in June 1540, the Privy Council became the most powerful ‘advisor’ for the final years of Henry’s reign, devolving influence at court across a select group rather than centring it in one dominant individual. In the seven years between Cromwell’s death and Henry’s, developments in the council’s organisation and administration offer important insights into power at the Tudor court. Despite this, the Privy Council has been fundamentally underserved in historical scholarship considering this period, with little critical investigation of the development of the institution in this time since surveys in the second half of the 20th Century, led by Geoffrey R. Elton and John Guy. Though work since has offered explorations of the early modern Privy Council, these focus primarily on the more defined Elizabethan Privy Council or include the council as part of a study on a single historical figure and their career. As such, there still remains little consensus on the development and establishment of the early Tudor council, and its role in governance. Building on key theories, methodologies, and quantitative measures developed in the field of network science and social network analysis, ‘A King’s Counsel: The Evolution of the Privy Council in the Reign of Henry VIII, 1530-1547,’ explores the development of this key early modern institution and its role as an influential and powerful entity at the court of Henry VIII.
